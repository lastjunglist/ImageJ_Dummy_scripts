Hello! I am a humble bioengineer with 0 life experience in coding, and **this rep is for keeping my ugly scripts to get some easy ImageJ stuff automated**.

# Grayscale_to_color 
This script was written for ImageJ 1.54d. If the output of your microscope is a grayscale image and you'd like it to be coloured in red, green or blue, this script will enable you to batch-process a folder of images and create an output folder containing the result.
# Cell_area_measurement
After live/dead imaging of spheroids on the confocal, I got a Z-stack series of images from two channels. I exported images as greyscale, and eventually in the folder I had tiff files with the names ending by ch00 (for green) and ch01 (for red). I wanted to calculate the total area of green (live) and red (dead) cells in each layer of my z-stack to calculate the ratio afterwards. This script enables me to do so.
